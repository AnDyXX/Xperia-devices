 * This module implements the Address Resolution Protocol ARP (RFC 826),
 * which is used to convert IP addresses (or in the future maybe other
 * high-level addresses) into a low-level hardware address (like an Ethernet
 * address).

 *
 * Fixes:
 *		Alan Cox	:	Removed the Ethernet assumptions in
 *					Florian's code
 *		Alan Cox	:	Fixed some small errors in the ARP
 *					logic
 *		Alan Cox	:	Allow >4K in /proc
 *		Alan Cox	:	Make ARP add its own protocol entry
 *		Ross Martin     :       Rewrote arp_rcv() and arp_get_info()
 *		Stephen Henson	:	Add AX25 support to arp_get_info()
 *		Alan Cox	:	Drop data when a device is downed.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Use init_timer().
 *		Alan Cox	:	Double lock fixes.
 *		Martin Seine	:	Move the arphdr structure
 *					to if_arp.h for compatibility.
 *					with BSD based programs.
 *		Andrew Tridgell :       Added ARP netmask code and
 *					re-arranged proxy handling.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Changed to use notifiers.
 *		Niibe Yutaka	:	Reply for this device or proxies only.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Don't proxy across hardware types!
 *		Jonathan Naylor :	Added support for NET/ROM.
 *		Mike Shaver     :       RFC1122 checks.
 *		Jonathan Naylor :	Only lookup the hardware address for
 *					the correct hardware type.
 *		Germano Caronni	:	Assorted subtle races.
 *		Craig Schlenter :	Don't modify permanent entry
 *					during arp_rcv.
 *		Russ Nelson	:	Tidied up a few bits.
 *		Alexey Kuznetsov:	Major changes to caching and behaviour,
 *					eg intelligent arp probing and
 *					generation
 *					of host down events.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Missing unlock in device events.
 *		Eckes		:	ARP ioctl control errors.
 *		Alexey Kuznetsov:	Arp free fix.
 *		Manuel Rodriguez:	Gratuitous ARP.
 *              Jonathan Layes  :       Added arpd support through kerneld
 *                                      message queue (960314)
 *		Mike Shaver	:	/proc/sys/net/ipv4/arp_* support
 *		Mike McLagan    :	Routing by source
 *		Stuart Cheshire	:	Metricom and grat arp fixes
 *					*** FOR 2.1 clean this up ***
 *		Lawrence V. Stefani: (08/12/96) Added FDDI support.
 *		Alan Cox 	:	Took the AP1000 nasty FDDI hack and
 *					folded into the mainstream FDDI code.
 *					Ack spit, Linus how did you allow that
 *					one in...
 *		Jes Sorensen	:	Make FDDI work again in 2.1.x and
 *					clean up the APFDDI & gen. FDDI bits.
 *		Alexey Kuznetsov:	new arp state machine;
 *					now it is in net/core/neighbour.c.
 *		Krzysztof Halasa:	Added Frame Relay ARP support.
 *		Arnaldo C. Melo :	convert /proc/net/arp to seq_file
 *		Shmulik Hen:		Split arp_send to arp_create and
 *					arp_xmit so intermediate drivers like
 *					bonding can change the skb before
 *					sending (e.g. insert 8021q tag).
 *		Harald Welte	:	convert to make use of jenkins hash
