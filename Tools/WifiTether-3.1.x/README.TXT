Wireless Tether for Root Users
--------------------------

This software turns your android-based handset (tested with a T-Mobile G1) into something like
a wireless access point (that's incorrect in technical-view because the wireless interface will be 
set up in AdHoc-Mode). Clients can connect via wifi or bluetooth and get access to internet using 
the 3G-connection (GPRS/EDGE/UMTS/HSDPA) which is established by the handset.

Warning:
--------
This application needs root-permission.
