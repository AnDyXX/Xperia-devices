/*
 * "splice": joining two ropes together by interweaving their strands.
 *
 * This is the "extended pipe" functionality, where a pipe is used as
 * an arbitrary in-memory buffer. Think of a pipe as a small kernel
 * buffer that you can use to transfer data from one end to the other.
 *
 * The traditional unix read/write is extended with a "splice()" operation
 * that transfers data buffers to or from a pipe buffer.
 *
 * Named by Larry McVoy, original implementation from Linus, extended by
 * Jens to support splicing to files, network, direct splicing, etc and
 * fixing lots of bugs.
